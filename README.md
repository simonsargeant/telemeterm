# telemeterm

Tracing backend on your terminal, for local visual debugging.

Reads traces exported by the Opentelemetry stdout exporter.

As this uses the stdout exporter there are no API guarantees. This means this may
not work depending on the version of the library you are using.

Work in progress and subject to change wildly and without warning.
